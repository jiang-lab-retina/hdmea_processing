# Specification Quality Checklist: Unified Pipeline Session

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-28  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The specification is derived from existing batch processing scripts that demonstrate the complete workflow
- The processing sequence (FR-012) is based on the actual order of batch processing scripts provided by the user
- The reference file for validation exists at the specified path
- All items pass validation - specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`

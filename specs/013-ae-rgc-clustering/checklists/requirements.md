# Specification Quality Checklist: Weakly Supervised RGC Clustering with Autoencoder Features

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-01-11  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification passed all validation checks
- Planning phase completed 2026-01-11
- All reasonable defaults were applied based on the detailed user input
- No clarification markers were needed - the user provided comprehensive specifications

## Planning Artifacts Created

- [x] `plan.md` - Implementation plan with architecture overview
- [x] `research.md` - Design decisions and alternatives considered
- [x] `data-model.md` - Entity schemas and relationships
- [x] `quickstart.md` - Usage guide with examples
- [x] `contracts/pipeline_api.md` - Internal API specifications

Tasks created via `/speckit.tasks` on 2026-01-11.

Ready for `/speckit.implement` to begin implementation.
